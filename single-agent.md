# Single-Agent

You are given the following context:
$ARGUMENTS

## Task

You are assigned to work on the given task as agent <agent_number>.

You can find the files in .claude/tasks/<task_name>/

Follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Think about the task

Use ultrathink to think about the task until you have a complete and comprehensive understanding of what you need to do.

## Step 2: Access the context.md file

The context.md file is a shared team file that contains the context for the task. Context is defined as any information that is relevant to the task including references to the codebase, documentation, etc.

The goal of the context.md file is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the task and the codebase so that any member of the team can easily and effectively work on the task and find what they need to know.

Read the context.md file for the task and use ultrathink if you need to do any more research.

Keep the context.md file updated if you find any new information that is relevant to the task and to your teammates.

## Step 3: Access the plan.md file

The plan.md file is a shared team file that contains the plan for the task. The plan is defined as a list of tasks that need to be completed to complete the task.

The goal of the plan.md file is to provide a comprehensive plan for the task so that any member of the team can easily and effectively work on the task and track their progress.

Read the plan.md file for the task and use ultrathink if you need to do any more research.

Keep the plan.md file updated with your progress and sign off on tasks with @agent\_<agent_number>.

## Step 4: Access your agent file

The agent\_<agent_number>.md file is your own file.

The goal of the agent\_<agent_number>.md file is to allow you a place to think, takes notes, and keep track of your progress as you work on the task.

Access your agent\_<agent_number>.md file based on your agent number. It defines your role and responsibilities.

You will update this file with your thinking, notes, and progress as you work on the task in the notepad section as bullet points.

Use it for anything you want to keep track of as you work on the task.

## Step 5: Access the team notepads

For each of your team members, read their agent\_<agent_number>.md file.

Important: You can only read the agent\_<agent_number>.md files of your team members. You cannot edit them. If you need to communicate with your team members, use the channel.md file.

## Step 6: Access the team chat channel

Access the channel.md file.

Use this file to communicate with your team members.

You can tag team members with @agent_number, multiple agents with @agent_number1, @agent_number2, etc., or the entire team with @all.

You can create threads by replying under a message as a new sub-message. You are encouraged to use threads to keep the conversation organized and easy to follow, just like a real team would in Slack.

Frequently check the channel.md file and update it as needed. Team collaboration is key to success.

Use the following format:

```md
## Messages

...

- agent_2: I've begun working on ...

- agent_1: I've completed ...

- agent_3: @agent_1, Can you create the API endpoints for ...

  - agent_1: No problem, I'll get started on ...

  - agent_3: @agent_1, That's now done. Let me know if ...

- agent_3: @all, Does anyone know if ...

  - agent_2: Yeah, you can use ...

- agent_2: Just finished the UI for ...

...
```

## Step 7: Start working

First, send a message to the team to let them know you are starting to work on the task.

Then, start working on the task.

Continue working on the task until you have completed it.

As you work, you should:

- check the channel.md file frequently and update it as needed
- keep the plan.md file updated with your progress and sign off on tasks with @agent\_<agent_number>
- keep the context.md file updated with your research as you work on the task
- update your agent\_<agent_number>.md file as you work on the task (reminder, you can only edit your own agent\_<agent_number>.md file)
- check team members' agent\_<agent_number>.md files for an async way to check in on progress, thoughts, etc when you need to (read only)
- use ultrathink liberally to help you work on the task, it is an extreme performance enhancer
- avoid stepping on your teammates' toes and use the channel.md file to communicate with them and prevent duplicate and conflicting work

## Step 8: Complete the task

Once you have completed the task, send a message to the team to let them know you have completed the task and update any relevant files.

As your teammates work, they may need you to jump back in! Continue to monitor the channel.md file and be ready to help out if needed.
